* GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving files that exceed the BSON-document size limit. [GridFS documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/)
* Pug,  template engine for Node.js. [Pug homepage](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
* Node.js, an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications.
